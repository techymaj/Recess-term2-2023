# An Exception is an error that happens during execution of a program.
# When that error occurs, Python generate an Exception that can be handled
# Which avoids your program to crash.

# Three types of errors can occur in a Python program:
# 1. Syntax errors
# 2. Logical errors
# 3. Runtime errors


# Exception Handling With Try & Except

# File Handling 
# Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.
# The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
# The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
# There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:
# "r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
# "a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
# "w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
# "x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

# In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode
# "t" - Text - Default value. Text mode
# "b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

# create a file called demofile.txt with the contents "This is a demo file"
print("#" * 80)
print("create a file with its contents")
